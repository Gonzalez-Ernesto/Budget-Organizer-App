# Project Title: Budget-Organizer-App

This application is intended to be a tool for managing individual finances. By entering personal but not compromising financial information, this app allows the user to get the monthly financial picture and generate some insights about the impact of likely economic changes.

Motivation: The main idea behind this project was to offer a solution to those who struggle the most with their finances, specifically hourly workers who do not have a fixed income due to the nature of their job and can not rely on a fixed monthly amount and instead are forced to take it week by week. 
Although the financial language used in this app could seem complicated, it is like the one used by banks, lenders, and financial institutions in general to overwhelm their targeted audience, and it was considered that rather than avoid it, it is better to familiarize the user with it.
    The implementation of all the functionalities was to address the learning objectives of the Python Developer Program from NCLab (highly recommended for those looking to learn Python in a fun way)

## Lessons Learned

This project was meant to be the capstone project of the Python Developer program at NcLab. I could proudly say that the NClab program gave me all the tools to implement the functionality of this app, and avoiding an Object Oriented Design was a priority to prove that although the introductory  Python Developer Course does not dive into OOP and other topics like resources and data structure, still offer not only the foundation to learn those advance concepts quickly but a set of tools to be successful in the industry starting at entry-level positions.
	Implementing the interface was the most challenging part of this project. Not using the PYQT5 editor was intentional for the same learning purpose described early; however, this approach and avoiding OOP design were costly in several ways. The first and most noticeable consequence was an interface that needed to be updated and attractive. At the implementation level, the most significant consequence was that the code grew exponentially to the order of thousands of lines, making it extremely hard for only one developer to debug and maintain the code.
    Lastly, since I did not have previous experience with PYQT5, the initial design had to be modified more than once, reaching improvisation more than once.
